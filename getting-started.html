The Demo Company comes pre-populated with dummy employees that you can use to play around on the system.</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> We recommend that you add another user to the account after signing up. This will ensure that another user is able to access the account should you lose your login details. More information about adding users can be found in the following article:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.simplepay.ie/help/setup/managing-users/add-users" class="">General Setup&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Managing Users&nbsp;&gt; Add Users</a></p></li></ul><p>As you have full access to the system during the trial period, we recommend setting up your own company from the start so that you can begin processing your actual payroll immediately. You are, of course, welcome to work with the Demo Company initially if you prefer.</p><p>You will have the option to switch to a paid account – either during your trial or after the&nbsp;expiry of your trial. Information on how to switch to paid and how you will be charged once you have a paid account can be found here:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/billing/switching-to-paid/" class="">Billing &gt; Switching to Paid</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/billing" class="">Billing</a></p></li></ul><h1 id="h1-addacompany">Add a Company</h1><p>Adding a company is a simple 3 step process. The steps are the same regardless of when you decide to add a company to SimplePay – initially, when you’ve signed up for a free trial or later on, when you want to add companies to your profile.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Enter Employer Details</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Create Pay Frequencies</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Add Employees</p></li></ul><p>Please refer to the following section for more information on each of these steps:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/setup/managing-companies#add-a-company" class="">General Setup &gt; Managing Companies &gt; Add a Company</a></p></li></ul><h1 id="h1-rosauthorisationcertificates">ROS Authorisation Certificates</h1><p>Under PAYE Modernisation, all employers must upload a ROS Digital Certificate into SimplePay before processing payroll. This certificate allows you to request RPNs (Revenue Payroll Notifications) for your employees and submit payroll information to Revenue after each pay period.</p><p>More information on these certificates, how to retrieve them and how to upload them into SimplePay can be found in this article:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/payroll-setup/company-setup/authorisation-certificates" class="">Payroll Setup&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Company Setup&nbsp;&gt; Authorisation Certificates</a></p></li></ul><h1 id="h1-employeerpnretrieval">Employee RPN Retrieval</h1><p>Once you’ve created a company and added your employees, the next step is retrieving their RPNs to ensure that PAYE, USC and LPT are calculated correctly. SimplePay runs this process daily but you can trigger it at any time manually from our Bulk Actions section. RPNs replaced P2Cs from January 2019 as part of Revenue’s upgrade to PAYE Modernisation.</p><p>Detailed information on RPN retrieval can be found in this article:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/payroll-setup/employee-setup/rpn-information" class="">Payroll Setup &gt; Employee Setup &gt; RPN Information</a></p></li></ul><h1 id="h1-basicpayslipsetup">Basic Payslip Setup</h1><p>Now that you have your employee’s all set up, you cans tart to process your payslips. If you click on an employee’s name when you are in the&nbsp;<strong>Employees&nbsp;</strong>tab, you will see the screen where you generate their payslips.</p><p>More information about the information that is entered on this screen can be found in the following article:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/payroll-processing/payslip-basics" class="">Payroll Processing &gt; Payslip Basics</a></p></li></ul><h1 id="h1-payruns">Pay Runs</h1><p>Once you have finalised all of your payslips, you will need to create a pay run. Pay runs are a means of grouping payslips; they are purely for convenience and do not affect any payslip data in any way. Creating a pay run allows you to print payslips in bulk, post to Xero (if you have set up the integration), download EFT files and send payslips to Self-Service (discussed below). Creating a pay run is simple – click on&nbsp;<strong>Pay Runs</strong>&nbsp;and then <strong>Create Pay Run</strong> for the relevant period. That’s it!</p><p>More information about pay runs can be found in the following article:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/payroll-processing/pay-runs" class="">Payroll Processing &gt; Pay Runs</a></p></li></ul><h1 id="h1-submissionstorevenue">Submissions to Revenue</h1><p>SimplePay is fully PAYE Modernisation ready, enabling you to do your payroll submissions quickly and easily with a click of a button. Simply complete your payroll processing for the relevant pay period and navigate to <strong>Filing</strong>&nbsp;&gt; <strong>Regular Submissions</strong>, where you can submit your payroll information directly from SimplePay to Revenue – no downloads, no fuss.</p><p>Details on the process for doing your payroll submission can be found in the following article:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/submissions-to-revenue" class="">Submissions to Revenue</a></p></li></ul><h1 id="h1-self-serviceforpayslips">Self-Service for Payslips</h1><p>You are able to download and email or print your employees’ payslips from the system by default; however, there is another option also – Employee Self-Service. This allows you to create accounts for your employees, which they can use to log in to SimplePay and view their payslips.</p><p>More information about self-service can be found in the following section:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/self-service-admin" class="">Self-Service Admin</a></p></li></ul><p>Once you have set up your employees for self-service, you will be prompted to release the payslips when creating pay runs. If you only set up self-service after creating previous pay runs, any payslips that are part of a pay run will automatically be released once your self-service settings are saved.</p><h1 id="h1-leaveapproval">Leave Approval</h1><p>In the previous section, you set up your employees for Self-Service so that they have access to their payslips; in addition, this login can be used to submit leave and info update requests. Before you can respond to employees’ requests, the company’s approval group(s) must be set up. This process is explained in the following article:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/self-service-admin/approval-structure-setup" class="">Self-Service Admin &gt; Approval Structure Setup</a></p></li></ul><h1 id="h1-additionaltopics">Additional Topics</h1><h2 id="h2-customitems"><em>Custom Items</em></h2><p>Wherever possible, we recommend using our built-in items as they may have special tax treatment attached to them. However, if necessary, you can create custom items by clicking on&nbsp;<strong>Settings &gt; Custom Items &gt; Add</strong>.</p><p>More information about custom items can be found in the following article:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/payroll-setup/company-setup/custom-items" class="">Payroll Setup &gt; Company Setup &gt; Custom Items</a></p></li></ul><h2 id="h2-endinganemployee’sservice"><em>Ending an Employee’s Service</em></h2><p>When an employee leaves the company, or if you want to remove them for any other reason, you will need to end their service. This has to be done individually for each employee.</p><p>More information about this can be found in the following article:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/payroll-processing/service-periods/ending-an-employees-service" class="">Payroll Processing &gt; Service Periods &gt; Ending an Employee’s Service</a></p></li></ul><h2 id="h2-eftsettings"><em>EFT Settings</em></h2><p>SimplePay generates EFT files that can be uploaded into any of the major banks’ online banking platforms, which enables you to pay all of your employees in one go with ease. However, you will first need to complete your company’s bank details.</p><p>More information about this can be found in the following article:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://simplepay.ie/help/payroll-setup/company-setup/eft-settings" class="">Payroll Setup &gt; Company Setup &gt; EFT Settings</a></p></li></ul><p>Please note that these settings are purely for the purpose of generating EFT files to pay your employees and have no bearing whatsoever on how you pay your SimplePay invoices.</p><h2 id="h2-leavemanagement"><em>Leave Management</em></h2><p>The SimplePay system has a comprehensive leave management function.
